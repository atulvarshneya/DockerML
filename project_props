# ######
# Create a file .project_props in the directory of the project. Be in that directory
# when you run the stc command to start a container. The .project_props file provides
# the parameters to be used to start the container specific for the project.
# The format of that file is provided here
# ######

## WARNING
# The '=' should appear only at one place as shown in the examples below,
# separating the parameter name and its value and not in the value of the parameter.
# Yes, this is a limitation.

## WARNING
# The command name and values are sensitive to extra spaces.
# So "NAME= xyz" and "NAME=xyz" are different.
# "NAME =xyz" will look for a parameter "NAME " and not "NAME"
# Yes, this is annoying.

## MANDATORY parameter
# --------------------
# NAME is the name of the container you wish to have for this project.
# Running the stc command again from the project directory will kill and remove any
# existing containers with this name and start a fresh one with this name
NAME=ML-CONTAINER

## MANDATORY parameter
# --------------------
# The docker image to run for this container
IMAGE=atulvarshneya/ml-image:latest-py3

## MANDATORY parameter
# --------------------
# WORKAREA directory that will be mounted in the container at /hostFS/`basename $WORKAREA`
# It is common to just give the value as current directory i.e., '.'
WORKAREA=.

## OPTIONAL parameter
# --------------------
# PORTMAP to map the container's EXPOSE'd ports to the host's ports.
# There can be multiple entries for the PORTMAP parameter.
# PORTMAP=8888:8888
# PORTMAP=54321:54321

## OPTIONAL parameter
# --------------------
# CDDIR to go to a specific directory on the start of the container. If you are going 
# to run a COMMAND (see below) that will be run from this directory
# CDDIR=/notebooks

## OPTIONAL parameter
# --------------------
# COMMAND the command to run at the start of the container.  This overrides the default
# command specified by the CMD in Dockerfile.
# Note: This gets overriden by the stc command options -c <command> and -i.
# COMMAND=/usr/local/bin/jupyter notebook --allow-root
